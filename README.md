# Machine Learnign with the Titanic disaster

Getting familiar with machine learning with the [Titanic dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The data exploration part is still left to do, since I want to create a dashboard with it.

The data is initially cleaned up from missing values, normalized (numerical variables) and encoded (categorical variables). Then, a Logistic Regression model is used to fit the data and tthe model is used to predict the test set. The model obtained a 76.555% accuracy, which is not bad considering the simplicity of the code.

The code can be seen in the `TitanicSurvival.ipynb` file, and the results are stored in the `surv_prediction.csv`. The data can bee downloaded from kaggle directly, but it is also stored in the `Data` direcory. the `gender_submission.csv` is an example of output given by kaggle.
